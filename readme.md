🚀 Getting Started
This repository is set up to handle versioning for your Lambda functions, ensuring that you have complete control over function updates, tracking, and deployment history.

Prerequisites
AWS Account: Set up an AWS Account if you haven't already.
AWS CLI: Make sure the AWS CLI is installed and configured.
CodeCommit Access: You’ll need proper IAM permissions for AWS CodeCommit access.
🛠️ Installation
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://git-codecommit.region.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/lambda-version-control
Set Up Dependencies Ensure all dependencies for Lambda functions are listed in a requirements.txt (Python) or package.json (Node.js) file within each function folder.
⚙️ Configuration
Repository Structure
Organize your Lambda functions as follows:

plaintext
Copy code
lambda-version-control/
├── function-name-1/
│   ├── version-1/
│   └── version-2/
└── function-name-2/
    ├── version-1/
    └── version-2/
Environment Variables
AWS_REGION - Specify the AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
LAMBDA_ROLE - Role ARN with permissions for your Lambda functions.

📚 Usage
Commit New Version

bash
Copy code
git add function-name/
git commit -m "Add version x for function-name"
git push origin main
Deploy a Lambda Function Use AWS CLI or your deployment pipeline to deploy specific function versions.

Version Rollback Easily switch to previous Lambda versions by updating the function alias or directly deploying older files.

🔒 Best Practices
Isolate Production Versions: Tag production-ready versions to avoid accidental changes.
Automate with CI/CD: Consider integrating with AWS CodePipeline for automated deployments.
Monitor Changes: Use CloudWatch logs for version-based monitoring.
